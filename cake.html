    <title>I Love Cake</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I love cake. I'm not afraid to shout it to the mountaintop.</h1>
<main>
<p>That's right. I love all kinds of cake. Chocolate, vanilla, cherry, and fruit based. If there is extra frosting or marzipan, all the better. I would happily run a 5k if there was cake at the finish line.</p>

<p>Cupcakes are a preferred way to enjoy cake. Many versions, all in little bite sized joy. Have one, have five! They are excellent.</p>

<p>Why, are you handing ME an oreo ice cream cake? How thoughtful of you!</p>

<p>Rainbow cakes are a great way to brighten up a gloomy day, and are also great for a surprise. Try one today. </p>

<p>Donuts get a bad rap, but I think donuts totally qualify as cake. Donut holes from Tim Horton's in Canada are the absolute best with a Double Double on the way to work in the snowy North.</p>
